Respected sir,

	Firstly i am apologizing because the Poll simulator is incomplete.
	reason:- i am unable to catch the logic behind how to store the counts and the vote in local storage without using databases.
		1. i tried using document.localstorge function
		2. i tried using document.sessionstorage function.
		3. i tried array and search for many more.
	i stucked many times in this problem but i was unable to get that storage locally on the browser.

i created home page, candidates page where already some students are registered, 
i created voting page where voters can vote and after that they will get the alert window for success vote.

if i was unable to understand the complete task so i am really sorry for that and i am still finding solution for this and 
analysing my mistakes, and if i am unable to find the solution than i will ask from you.

Thank You
